    "Ordinal encoding and label encoding are two common techniques used for encoding categorical variables in machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Label encoding involves assigning a unique numerical value to each category in a categorical variable. For example, \n",
    "if we have a categorical variable 'color' with categories 'red', 'green', and 'blue', we could assign the values 0, 1, and 2 to the categories, \n",
    "respectively. The order of the values assigned does not matter, and label encoding does not imply any order or hierarchy among the categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordinal encoding, on the other hand, is a similar process but assigns values based on the order of the categories. \n",
    "For example, if we have a categorical variable 'size' with categories 'small', 'medium', and 'large', we could assign the values 0, 1, and 2 to\n",
    "the categories, respectively. Here, the order of the values assigned reflects the order of the categories, with 'small' being assigned the lowest \n",
    "value, and 'large' being assigned the highest.\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases, using ordinal encoding might be more appropriate than label encoding. For example, if we have a categorical variable 'temperature' with\n",
    "categories 'low', 'medium', and 'high', using ordinal encoding would reflect the natural ordering of the categories. However, if we have a categorical\n",
    "variable 'color' with categories 'red', 'green', and 'blue', using label encoding might be more appropriate since the categories do not have a natural\n",
    "ordering.\n",

    "Target Guided Ordinal Encoding is a technique used for encoding categorical variables based on the relationship between the categorical variable and \n",
    "the target variable in a supervised learning problem. This encoding method involves replacing the categories of a categorical variable with ordinal \n",
    "numbers that reflect the relationship between the category and the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of Target Guided Ordinal Encoding involves the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Calculate the mean or median of the target variable for each category of the categorical variable.\n",
    "2.Sort the categories in ascending or descending order based on the mean or median of the target variable.\n",
    "3.Assign ordinal values to each category based on their position in the sorted list.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's say we have a dataset that contains a categorical variable \"city\" with values 'New York', 'Boston', 'San Francisco', and 'Chicago'.\n",
    "We want to predict the income of people living in each city, and we notice that there is a strong relationship between the city and income. \n",
    "We can use Target Guided Ordinal Encoding to encode the \"city\" variable as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Calculate the mean income for each city. Let's say the mean incomes are: 'New York' - $80,000, 'Boston' - $75,000, 'San Francisco' - $90,000, and\n",
    "'Chicago' - $70,000.\n",
    "2.Sort the cities in descending order based on the mean income: 'San Francisco', 'New York', 'Boston', 'Chicago'.\n",
    "3.Assign ordinal values to each city based on their position in the sorted list: 'San Francisco' - 4, 'New York' - 3, 'Boston' - 2, 'Chicago' - 1.\n",
    "Now we have encoded the categorical variable \"city\" as an ordinal variable that reflects the relationship between the city and income.\n",
    "\n",
    "We might choose to use Target Guided Ordinal Encoding in a machine learning project when we have a categorical variable that we believe has a strong \n",
    "relationship with the target variable, and we want to capture this relationship in our model. This encoding method can help improve the performance \n",
