    "Estimation statistics is a branch of statistics that deals with making inferences about a population based on information gathered from a sample. \n",
    "It involves using sample statistics to estimate population parameters. There are two types of estimates: point estimate and interval estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "A point estimate is a single value that is used to estimate the population parameter.\n",
    "It is computed from a sample statistic, such as the sample mean or sample proportion. \n",
    "For example, if we want to estimate the population mean height of college students, \n",
    "we can take a random sample of college students and compute the sample mean height. \n",
    "he sample mean height is the point estimate of the population mean height.\n",
    "\n",
    "An interval estimate, on the other hand, is a range of values that is likely to contain the population parameter.\n",
    "It is computed from the sample statistic and takes into account the variability of the sample. \n",
    "The most common type of interval estimate is the confidence interval, \n",
    "which is a range of values that is likely to contain the population parameter with a certain level of confidence. \n",
    "For example, we can compute a 95% confidence interval for the population mean height of college students based on the sample mean height and the standard error of the mean. \n",
    "This interval estimate tells us that we are 95% confident that the true population mean height falls within the range of values computed from the sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, estimation statistics involves using sample statistics to estimate population parameters.\n",
    "Point estimates are single values used to estimate the population parameter, \n",

    "Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to test a hypothesis about a population parameter based on sample data. \n",
    "In hypothesis testing, \n",
    "we start with a null hypothesis (H0) that assumes there is no significant difference between a population parameter and a sample statistic.\n",

    "Hypothesis testing is used to make decisions and draw conclusions about a population based on sample data.\n",

    "It is a powerful tool for making data-driven decisions and ensuring that our conclusions are based on sound statistical analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The importance of hypothesis testing lies in its ability to provide a framework for making decisions and drawing conclusions based on data. \n",
    "By setting up a null hypothesis and collecting sample data, we can determine whether the null hypothesis is likely to be true or false. \n",
