    "Linear regression is a widely used statistical technique that models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent\n",

    "\n",
    "Linearity: The relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variables is linear. This means that the change in the dependent\n",

    "\n",
    "Independence: The observations are independent of each other. This means that the value of the dependent variable for one observation does not \n",
    "depend on the value of the dependent variable for another observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Homoscedasticity: The variance of the errors is constant across all values of the independent variable. This means that the spread of the errors \n",
    "is the same for all values of the independent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normality: The errors are normally distributed. This means that the distribution of the errors is symmetric and bell-shaped.\n",

    "If the relationship is not linear, other modeling techniques may be more appropriate.\n",

    "Residual plots: A residual plot can be used to check for the assumptions of independence, homoscedasticity, and normality. \n",
    "If the errors are independent, the residuals should be randomly scattered around zero. If the errors have constant variance, the residuals \n",
    "should be equally spread across the range of the independent variable. If the errors are normally distributed, the residuals should follow a\n",
