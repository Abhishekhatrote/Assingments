    "Embedded feature selection is a type of feature selection technique that performs feature selection as part of the machine learning \n",

    "\n",
    "1. Regularization methods: Regularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting in machine learning models.\n",

    "Some of the most significant drawbacks of the Filter method include:\n",
    "\n",
    "   1. Limited feature selection: The Filter method ranks features based on their correlation with the target variable and selects the top n features \n",

    "   2. Correlated features: The Filter method can suffer from the issue of selecting redundant features that are highly correlated with each other.\n",
    "    Highly correlated features can lead to overfitting and negatively impact the performance of the machine learning model.\n",
    "\n",
    "   3. Insensitive to the machine learning model: The Filter method ranks features independently of the machine learning model being used. \n",
