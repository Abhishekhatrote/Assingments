    "The wine quality dataset is a well-known dataset in machine learning and consists of chemical properties of different types of wines, \n",

    "\n",
    "Mean imputation: In this technique, missing values are replaced with the mean value of the feature. This is a simple and quick technique that can work\n",
    "well if the missing values are randomly distributed. However, it can introduce bias if the missing values are not random.\n",
    "\n",
    "Median imputation: This technique is similar to mean imputation, but the median value of the feature is used instead of the mean. This can be a better\n",
    "option if the feature has outliers that can skew the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mode imputation: In this technique, missing values are replaced with the mode (most common) value of the feature. This can be useful for categorical \n",
    "features, but it may not work well for continuous features.\n",
    "\n",
    "KNN imputation: In this technique, missing values are replaced with the values of the nearest neighbors in the dataset. This can be a more accurate \n",
    "imputation technique than mean or median imputation, but it can be computationally intensive and may not work well for high-dimensional datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regression imputation: In this technique, a regression model is used to predict missing values based on other features in the dataset. This can be a \n",
    "very accurate imputation technique if the regression model is well-designed, but it can be time-consuming and may not work well if there are strong\n",
    "nonlinear relationships between features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these techniques has advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of imputation technique depends on the specific characteristics of the \n",
    "dataset and the goals of the analysis. Ultimately, the goal of imputation is to minimize the impact of missing data on the accuracy of the analysis,\n",
    "and the best technique will depend on the specific trade-offs between accuracy, computational cost, and interpretability.\n",
