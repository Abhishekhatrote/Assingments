    "In Python, an exception is an error that occurs during the execution of a program. When a program encounters an error, it raises an exception, which is a signal to the program that something has gone wrong. Exceptions can occur due to various reasons, such as invalid input, missing files, network errors, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "When an exception is raised, Python stops the normal execution of the program and looks for an exception handler that can handle the error. If no handler is found, the program terminates and displays an error message to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax errors, on the other hand, occur when the code violates the rules of the Python language. These errors are caught by the Python interpreter before the code is executed. Syntax errors typically occur due to typos, missing parentheses, or incorrect indentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some key differences between exceptions and syntax errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "1)Exceptions occur during the execution of a program, while syntax errors occur before the program is executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2)Exceptions are raised by the program, while syntax errors are caught by the Python interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "3Exceptions can be handled by the program using try-except blocks, while syntax errors cannot be handled by the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "4)Exceptions are caused by factors such as invalid input, missing files, or network errors, while syntax errors are caused by mistakes in the code itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "5)Exceptions can occur in both well-formed and poorly-formed code, while syntax errors only occur in poorly-formed code.\n",
