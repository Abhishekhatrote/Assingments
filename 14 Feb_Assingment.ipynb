    "1)Faster Execution: Multithreading can help programs to run faster by executing different parts of the program simultaneously. \n",
    "This can be especially useful for programs that perform complex calculations or need to process large amounts of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2)Resource Sharing: Multithreading allows threads to share resources such as memory, file handles, and network connections, \n",

    "3)Improved Responsiveness: Multithreading can improve the responsiveness of a program by allowing it to perform \n",

    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1)Increased Complexity: Multithreading can make programs more complex and harder to understand and debug, \n",

    "4)Deadlocks and Race Conditions: Multithreading can introduce synchronization issues such as deadlocks and race conditions, \n",
