    "In machine learning, the process of building a model typically involves dividing the available data into three subsets: \n",

    "It is used to tune the hyperparameters of the model, such as the learning rate, number of hidden layers, or regularization parameter,\n",
    "to improve the performance on unseen data. The validation set is typically used to select the best model among a set of candidate models.\n",
